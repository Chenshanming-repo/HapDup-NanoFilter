# HapDup: A Pipeline for Diploid Assembly Using Long Reads

HapDup is a pipeline designed to convert a haploid long-read assembler into a diploid assembler. This enables the diploid assembly of genomes using tools such as Flye, PEPPER, and Margin. The pipeline has been enhanced with **NanoFilter** integration for improved phasing accuracy and assembly performance.
